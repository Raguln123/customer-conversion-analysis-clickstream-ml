## Project Snapshot (1-sentence)

A Streamlit web app and ML pipeline that uses clickstream data to (1) classify whether a user will convert, (2) regress predicted revenue, and (3) cluster users for segmentation — end-to-end from preprocessing to deployment.

---

## Key Features 

* Classification: predict purchase conversion (converted / not converted).
* Regression: estimate potential revenue per session.
* Clustering: segment users for targeted marketing.
* Robust pipeline: preprocessing → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → Streamlit deployment.
* Balance handling: SMOTE / undersampling / class weights.
* Models used: Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, and simple NN (optional).
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC (classification); RMSE, MAE, R² (regression); Silhouette & Davies-Bouldin (clustering).

## Quick Setup — Commands (copy/paste)

> **Note:** replace `python` with `python3` on systems where `python` points to v2.

### 1) Check Python

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

### 2) Create & activate virtual environment

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Windows (CMD)**

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3) Ensure pip is available & upgraded

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 4) Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

Create `requirements.txt` with the following contents (or use the provided file):

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
streamlit
notebook
jupyterlab
imbalanced-learn
```

Install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install everything in one line:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn xgboost streamlit notebook jupyterlab imbalanced-learn
```

### 5) Run preprocessing (example)

```bash
# from repo root
python scripts/preprocessing.py  # adjust if script requires args
```

*(If your script expects file paths, example: `python scripts/preprocessing.py --input data/train.csv --output data/preprocessed_train.csv`)*

### 6) Train models

```bash
python scripts/model_training.py  # trains classification & regression and saves to models/
```

*(Add `--config` or `--model` flags if you implemented CLI args.)*

### 7) Run Streamlit app

```bash
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown in terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Git / GitHub — Commands (push once)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Customer Conversion Analysis"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-conversion-analysis.git
git push -u origin main
```

If repo already exists:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-conversion-analysis.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Docker (optional) — quick commands

Create `Dockerfile` (example):

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "streamlit_app/app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Build & run:

```bash
docker build -t clickstream-app .
docker run -p 8501:8501 clickstream-app
```

---

## .gitignore suggestions

```
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
models/
*.pkl
*.csv
.DS_Store
.env
```

> Keep `models/` out of Git if models are large — use Git LFS or store models in a separate artifact storage.

## Common Troubleshooting & Tips

* `pip not found`: make sure venv activated. Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
* `streamlit: command not found`: ensure venv active or install globally: `pip install streamlit`.
* Model load errors: relative paths — use absolute or `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / 'models'`.
* Large datasets: sample locally for prototyping using `df.sample(frac=0.1, random_state=42)`.
* Reproducibility: set `random_state=42` for model splitting and clustering.

## Interview Cheat-sheet — What to say & expect

### Elevator pitch (15–30s)

“Using clickstream logs from an e-commerce store, I built a pipeline that predicts if a session will convert, estimates the revenue per session, and clusters users into behavioral segments. The system includes data cleaning, feature engineering (session length, clicks per category, bounce/exit rates), model training with RandomForest/XGBoost, and a Streamlit app for live predictions and visualization.”

### Features you engineered (say 3–5)

* Session length (time between first and last click)
* Number of product page views per session
* Click sequence length and last page visited
* Average price viewed vs category mean (binary flag)
* Hour-of-day / day-of-week features for temporal behavior

### Models & why

* Logistic Regression for baseline classification (interpretable).
* RandomForest / XGBoost for performance (handles nonlinearity & interactions).
* RandomForestRegressor / GradientBoost for revenue forecast.
* KMeans / DBSCAN for clustering based on L2 behavior features.

### Metrics & tradeoffs

* Prioritize recall (or precision) depending on business objective; e.g., if you want to capture as many potential buyers as possible, maximize recall (accept more false positives).
* Use ROC-AUC for threshold-agnostic performance; use precision/recall tradeoffs for operational thresholds.

### Typical interview questions & good short answers

* Q: “How did you handle class imbalance?”
  A: “Checked label distribution, then used SMOTE for oversampling and experimented with class weights and undersampling; selected method via cross-validation metrics.”

* Q: “How would you deploy this in production?”
  A: “Containerize with Docker, push image to registry, run in Kubernetes or serverless platform. Use CI to retrain and store artifacts, serve predictions via a REST API or Streamlit behind authentication for internal users.”

* Q: “How do you ensure model fairness / data drift?”
  A: “Monitor input distributions and prediction metrics over time, set alerts for drift with population stability index (PSI), and schedule periodic retraining and validation.”

---

## Next steps / Extensions (nice to mention)

* Add explainability (SHAP) to explain per-session predictions.
* Build REST API (FastAPI) for production inference.
* Add A/B testing to measure downstream business impact.
* Connect model retraining pipeline to CI/CD pipeline and dataset versioning (DVC).
